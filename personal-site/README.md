Update 2-17: I've restructured my personal website home page which I will be making for the course project.
I've added some cool styling to some of my text and made new tabs for what I will eventually add.  I've also
added some of the next CSS concepts we have learned this week.

Update 2-23: I've spent most of this week migrating my current work on my course project (personal site) into a React Ionic project and flushing out a few more pages in my site.  Currently I have a Home page, Resume page, and Contact page.  I still plan on adding 2 more pages relating to personal interests.
