Update 2-17: I've restructured my personal website home page which I will be making for the course project.
I've added some cool styling to some of my text and made new tabs for what I will eventually add.  I've also
added some of the next CSS concepts we have learned this week.

Update 2-23: I've spent most of this week migrating my current work on my course project (personal site) into a React Ionic project and flushing out a few more pages in my site.  Currently I have a Home page, Resume page, and Contact page.  I still plan on adding 2 more pages relating to personal interests.

Update 3-3: I have updated my contact form to be a feedback form.  This form will check for valid email and not allow submissions with invalid emails.  It will also alert the user of the number of characters they left in the feedback details text area. I've added two more pages during this week and cleaned up a few of my existing pages (now totaling 5).  My first new page
is my golf page, which shows my recent golf scores and other information.  I also added a movie review page, where I can post my
recent movies I've seen and my reviews of them.  Just to note, this page is a work in progress.  I plan on adding more reviews and
cleaning up some styling.

Update 3-10: I have spent the last week adding a dropdown for my golf page, which allows users to select a specific club value and see information displayed
for the specific club that they pick.  The dropdown selections change color on hover.  I have also added a dark mode toggle which can be found on the top right
of the home page.  I have also focused on cleaning up some of my existing pages, and I feel like I am starting to get to a good point for the mid term point.
